This library allows a webpage to implement audio calls or other voice
chat functionality.

To use, simply include the micstream.js file (located in static/js)
in your webpage, along with the dependency resampler.js (located in static/js).

Then, all you need to do is create the object:


var micstream = new MicStream(workOutWSURI() +"/connect/testconn", false, true, true, true);


The syntax is:

MicStream(<websocketURI>, <enable Microphone Transmission>, <enable reciever>, <enable compression>, <enable debug>)





The server side has a single responsibility - relay binary websocket frames
from the two ends. The demo (written in Golang) does this.
